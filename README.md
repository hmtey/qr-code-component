## My process

### Time taken

- 3-4 hours

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Was a good refresher for the very basics of HTML & CSS. My first time encountering and using web fonts, which led me to explore ```@font-face``` and ```@import``` rules.

Implemented in ```index.css```:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```
